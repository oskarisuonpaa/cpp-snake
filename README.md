## Installation

To install and set up this project, you will need a C++ compiler. Download the `snake.cpp` file and compile it using your compiler.

## Usage

After compiling the `snake.cpp` file, run the resulting executable to start the game. The game is played by controlling the snake, represented by "O" as the head and "o" as the body, with WASD-keys. The goal is to eat as many fruits, represented by "F", as possible, without running into the snake's tail which leads to game over. Additionally, the game can also be ended by pressing X-key.

## Note

The game only works on Windows, other operating systems require the code to be modified.
